I am a statistics scholar, seeking to understand what is apparently chaotic and to see hidden patterns.

*I have been put to death on the cross with Christ; still I am living; no longer I, but Christ is living in me; and that life which I now am living in the flesh I am living by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who in love for me, gave himself up for me.* - Galatians 2:20.

*Dominus illuminatio mea*
